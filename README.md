# Acquisition-Viz
A data visualization of company acquisitions in tech industry from 1980 to 2015
This visualization shows the progression of company acquisitions over time. 
This tells a story about the history of each company, the types of companies they are interested in, 
and paints an overall picture of where the tech industry is going. The visualization is relevant and 
unique because we havenâ€™t seen a visualization that tells this story yet and we were curious to see what 
the data on the excel sheet would show.

The dataset is from Enigma.io and shows over 8,500 company acquisitions, dates, and the names of acquired 
companies from the Crunchable database. It is significant for a couple reasons. First, it gives us 
an idea of where the industries are going. Second, it gives us insight into the strategies of the individual 
companies. We had many issues we had to work through to get the data to work and tell a story. To make 
things more interesting, we went through and manually searched for the categories for the acquired 
companies because this would be the most interesting thing to visualize.
